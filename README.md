## Dynamic web application built with Java Spring MVC and Thymeleaf template engine.
## DBMS used in development: Microsoft SQL Server

This is a personal small Java/Spring project developed in the frame of my studies in TSI in course Object-Oriented Programming. The main idea was
to create a cute gallery application with real estate properties, with option to register/log-in, develop personal profile and wishlist,
and communicate with other users. Sort of combining some features of e-commerce and some of the social network.

To run the application, download the project or pull it from this Git repo. Open prefferably in IntelliJ Idea 
and run main method in the main class "CourseprojectApplication". There may be some conflicts regarding the database,
which I assume it is solved individually based of your preferences, PC capabilities, and intentions of usage.
